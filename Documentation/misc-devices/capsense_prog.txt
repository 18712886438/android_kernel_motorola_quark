			Cypress CapSense devices programming support
			--------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

This driver implements the programming for Linux of Cypress CapSense devices by
simulating in-system serial programming protocol (ISSP) on GPIO pins.
By using this driver you can reprogram the in-system flash without additional
adapters. This solution is working with blank or non-blank flash memory.
Current release was tested with cy8c20237_24lkxi CapSense device.

Device tree nodes
-----------------

label         - IC type name, it is used to identify firmware file name
silicon_id    - IC type identifier, used to identify connected IC.
block_size    - In-system flash memory block size
num_of_blocks - Number of flash memory blocks.
secure_bytes  - Each block has 2 bits in flash memory for protection attributes;
gpios         - Three interface gpio pins. Index 0 is reset line,
				index 1 - clock line, index 2 - data line.


Using the driver
----------------

Once the driver is loaded you can use sysfs support to erase or to program
in-system flash memory.

1. Program firmware with auto-matching file name and silicon Id. If file with
name cy8c20237_24lkxi.hex present in directory /system/etc/firmware and HW
system has IC cy8c20237_24lkxi then following command will automatically flash
firmware to IC. Firmware will be flashed if checksum in hex file does not match
with checksum of in-system flash memory:

#find -name cycapsense_fw
./sys/devices/cy8c20237_prog.72/cycapsense_fw
#echo 1 > /sys/devices/cy8c20237_prog.72/cycapsense_fw

2. Program firmware without checking name and checksum. If file <file_name>.hex
is present in /system/etc/firmware directory you may program it with following
command:

#echo <file_name>.hex > /sys/devices/cy8c20237_prog.72/cycapsense_fw

3. To erase in-system flash memory:

#echo erase > /sys/devices/cy8c20237_prog.72/cycapsense_fw

4. To use driver from another module there is exported API cycapsense_fw_update,
which implements same logic as case #1 above.
