      CapSense devices is the analog system contains the capacitive sensing
      hardware. Several hardware algorithms are supported. This hardware
      performs capacitive sensing and scanning without requiring external
      components. It contains internal flash memory, which have to be programmed
      with firmware. This option enables firmware programming driver and allows
      automatically identify device and matching firmware. See file
      Documentation/misc-devices/capsense_prog.txt for details.
